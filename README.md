In the server directory, create a .env file with two fields: "MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING" and "SESSION_SECRET"

In "MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING" place your mongo connection string from you MongoDB account.
In "SESSION_SECRET" type in a random string. This will be used for generating session tokens for users.
